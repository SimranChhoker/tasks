        <h2>Breeds of the year</h2>
        <p>
            The German Shepherd Dog has slipped down the rankings two places since 2019, 
 but they have a strong following of loyal fans nevertheless. This breed has an exceptional work ethic and is prized as 
 a working breed. They also make exceptional family pets, although they can be quite disinterested in strangers and 
 visitors whom they dont know well. This active breed needs plenty of exercise and opportunities for mental stimulation.
 Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble
 character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight.
 German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth,
 graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach 
 great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their
  defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the
 willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast
 guardians, but, the breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and 
 indiscriminate friendships.'</p>
<p> The Golden Retriever consistently ranks as one of the most popular dog breeds and for good reason! These adorable dogs 
 are affectionate and loyal but can also be focused and serious when working. They have a cheerful disposition and are 
 always happy and eager to please their owners. That happy-go-lucky exterior masks a fierce intelligence and a strong 
 work ethic, which makes them the go-to choice as guide dogs and the perfect family companion.
 The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate
 nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in 
 several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, 
 and may be trained for use as a guide dog.The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate 
Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some 
further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 
1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.</p>
<p>Maltese dog refers both to an ancient variety of dwarf canine from Italy[1] and generally associated also with the 
 island of Malta, and to a modern breed of dog in the toy group. The contemporary variety is genetically related to 
 the Bichon, Bolognese, and Havanese breeds.The tiny Maltese, 'Ye Ancient Dogge of Malta,' has been sitting in the lap 
 of luxury since the Bible was a work in progress. Famous for their show-stopping, floor-length coat, Maltese are playful, 
 charming, and adaptable toy companions.Maltese are affectionate toy dogs weighing less than seven pounds, covered by a
 long, straight, silky coat. Beneath the all-white mantle is a compact body moving with a smooth and effortless gait.
 The overall picture depicts free-flowing elegance and balance. The irresistible Maltese face' with its big, dark eyes 
 and black gumdrop nose' can conquer the most jaded sensibility.     Despite their aristocratic bearing, Maltese are 
 hardy and adaptable pets. They make alert watchdogs who are fearless in a charming toy-dog way, and they are game little
 athletes on the agility course. Maltese are low-shedding, long-lived, and happy to make new friends of all ages. 
Sometimes stubborn and willful, they respond well to rewards-based training.</p>
<p>That face! Those big dark eyes looking up at you with that sweet expression! It's no surprise that Shih Tzu owners 
have been so delighted with this little 'Lion Dog' for a thousand years. Where Shih Tzu go, giggles and mischief follow. 
Shi Tsu (pronounced in the West 'sheed-zoo' or 'sheet-su'; the Chinese say 'sher-zer'), weighing between 9 to 16 pounds,
 and standing between 8 and 11 inches, are surprisingly solid for dogs their size. The coat, which comes in many colors,
  is worth the time you will put into it'¿few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu. Being cute is a way of life 
  for this lively charmer. The Shih Tzu is known to be especially affectionate with children. As a small dog bred to spend 
  most of their day inside royal palaces, they make a great pet if you live in an apartment or lack a big backyard. Some 
  dogs live to dig holes and chase cats, but a Shih Tzu's idea of fun is sitting in your lap acting adorable as you try 
  to watch TV.Shih Tzus are known for their short snouts and large round eyes, as well as their long coat, floppy ears, and short
  and stout posture. They are well known for their playful personality and their calm and friendly temperament.
They can adapt well to different situations. Due to their highly independent nature, they are not considered the most 
obedient breed.
